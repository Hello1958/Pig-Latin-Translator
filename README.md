# Pig Latin Translator
This is a Pig Latin translator. This repository contains various modules concerned with encoding and decoding Pig Latin. (Sidenote: the decode function uses AI for translation, and you will need a Google AI API key in order to use it.) See the license (MIT License) and Code of Conduct for appropriate usage guidlines.

## API Key
To get started with decoding, navigate to the main script (named Pig Latin Translator.py). From lines 1 through 12 there will be instructions on how to get your API key. You need a Google account to use this key. If you don't have one, you can go here: https://accounts.google.com/v3/signin/identifier?continue=https://mail.google.com/mail/&service=mail&theme=glif&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=ServiceLogin to create one. Click "Create an Account" to do it. It's right next to the blue "Next" button.

## Implementation
In Pig Latin Translator.py, find the variable API_KEY. It should be in line 17. Paste your API key <ins>inside</ins> the quotation marks. Once this is done, run the file and get started on your Pig Latin language journey!
